# TUM - Advanced Deep Learning for Robotics
This repository contains the project source code of our team ([@rajk853](https://github.com/rajk853), [@saif61](https://github.com/saif61)) for the TUM - Advanced Deep Learning for Robotics SS21 course.

## Objective
As part of this project, we will investigate the ideas proposed by [Li and Malik, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01885) for an optimization based motion planning and further investigate it by integrating RL based approaches. 

## TODOs
- Set up an optimizer for a simple robot
- Implement RL to guide the optimizer
